What is a CTF?
CTF stands for Capture The Flag, a style of hacking event where you have one goal: hack in and find the flag. Flags are placed in various locations -- they might be in a file, in the database, stuck into source code, or otherwise -- and your goal is to hunt them all down. Each flag looks something like ^FLAG^37ae568362f974017fa575f08cd215044cd6bb395c3f5e5e293ee5324ba6769c$FLAG$, so you'll know the instant you see one.

Stuck?
If you get stuck, try going through a level from scratch and see if you missed something along the way. Did you inspect every page thoroughly? Press every button? Manipulate every input? Try not to overthink it too much; the flags are usually more obvious than you might think.
If you think you've looked over everything, check out the hints for the level. Click the "Hints" link next to the "Go" button that launches an instance and you'll get a helping hand.
